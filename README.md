This repository demonstrates a common performance issue in React Native's FlatList component when dealing with large datasets and complex render functions. The `FlatListBug.js` file shows an example of inefficient rendering leading to performance problems.  The `FlatListSolution.js` file offers solutions, including using `getItemLayout`, `keyExtractor`, and optimizing the `renderItem` function for better performance. This is a common problem faced by React Native developers, and understanding these optimizations is crucial for creating smooth and responsive UIs.
