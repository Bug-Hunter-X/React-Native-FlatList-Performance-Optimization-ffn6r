This bug occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native with a large dataset and complex render items. The issue manifests as slow rendering and scrolling performance, often causing janky animations and UI freezes. The root cause is usually inefficient rendering or data handling within the FlatList's renderItem function.  For example, calculations or excessive re-renders within this function for each item can significantly impact performance.  Another potential cause is not using appropriate optimization techniques like `getItemLayout` or `keyExtractor`.
